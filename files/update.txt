; You should not need to edit this file.
;
; This file holds the names of widgets that do not need to be transferred.
; For example, when updating DiskC to Disk, we do not want to transfer DiskC, so we do this:
; del DiskC
; Of course, we still want to make sure that Candlelight boots, so let's replace the widget:
; wrep DiskC Disk
;
; wrep - Widget replace, replace a widget with another
; del - Do not transfer this widget to this update
